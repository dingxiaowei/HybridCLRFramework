See the documentation if you are receiving import errors:

If you purchased the First Person Controller or the Third Person Controller there will be an Ultimate Character Controller Demo scene.
This scene requires both the First Person Controller and the Third Person Controller imported in order for it to work.

Feel free to get in contact with us if you have any questions. Good luck on your project!
